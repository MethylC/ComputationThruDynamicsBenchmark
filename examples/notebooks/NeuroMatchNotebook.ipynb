    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers training artificial networks to perform tasks (e.g., image classification, motor control) have found that the activity in the artificial networks can resemble the activity of biological neurons from brain areas thought to perform similar tasks. Unfortunately, it is unclear whether a superficial similarity in neural activation necessarily translates to a conserved computational strategy. We need ways to assess how well different models are able to capture the computational principles, which will require datasets where the ground-truth computations are known and we can analyze similarity between artificial and natural systems. The aim of this project is to explore ways to measure alignment in dynamical systems, and to study different approaches to quantify the changes in representations across different tasks and across different architectures.\n",
